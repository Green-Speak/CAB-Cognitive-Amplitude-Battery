CAB-CognitiveAptitudeBattery

A digital cognitive test battery featuring multiple subtests, audio-based tasks, and a unified scoring system.

Overview

The Cognitive Amplitude Battery (CAB) is a Windows Forms–based application designed to measure cognitive aptitude across several key cognitive domains. The goal of the project is to provide a structured, interactive, and educational environment for assessing different aspects of human cognition.

While inspired by principles used in established intelligence assessments, CAB is not intended to replace professional psychological tests. Instead, it serves as a learning project and a functional demonstration of how cognitive evaluation software can work.

Cognitive Domains

CAB evaluates multiple cognitive domains, including—but not limited to:

Processing Speed Ability to quickly perceive, process, and respond to visual or auditory information.

Working Memory Capacity to store and manipulate information in the short term (e.g., digit span tasks).

Fluid Reasoning Skill in solving novel problems, identifying patterns, and applying logic.

Verbal Comprehension Understanding and using language in a meaningful way.

Each domain is measured through dedicated subtests, designed to target specific cognitive processes.

How the Test Works

1.The user completes a series of subtests covering different cognitive domains.

2.Raw scores are collected and stored.

3.The application converts raw scores into scaled scores through normalization principles.

4.Scaled scores are aggregated into index values representing each cognitive domain.

5.A final composite value approximates a general cognitive ability score, highlighting:

Overall performance

Individual cognitive strengths

Individual cognitive weaknesses

Disclaimer

This application is not a medical, diagnostic, or psychological tool. It is a personal software project created for educational and experimental purposes. The CAB is not validated and cannot replace a professional cognitive or intelligence assessment. Results should not be interpreted as clinical, official, or scientifically standardized.
